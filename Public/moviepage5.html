                <!-- <h4>Description:-</h4> -->
                <p>Jawan is a 2023 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film co-written and directed by Atlee in his Hindi film debut. It is produced by Gauri Khan and Gaurav Verma under Red Chillies Entertainment. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan in a dual role as father and son who team up to rectify corruption in society. Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi, Deepika Padukone (billed as a special appearance), Priyamani and Sanya Malhotra appear in supporting roles.
                Principal photography commenced in September 2021 with filming taking place in Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Rajasthan and Aurangabad. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by Anirudh Ravichander, with cinematography by G. K. Vishnu and editing by Ruben. A few scenes were simultaneously re-shot for the Tamil version of the film, particularly Khan's appearance in the song "Zinda Banda" ("Vandha Edam" in Tamil), Sethupathi's portions and scenes featuring Yogi Babu.
                Jawan was initially planned for release on 2 June 2023, but was postponed due to unfinished post-production work.[7] It was theatrically released on 7 September 2023 in standard, IMAX, 4DX and other premium formats, coinciding with Janmashtami. Jawan received positive reviews from critics who praised its cast performances, screenwriting, action sequences and musical score. The film set several box-office records for a Hindi film, overtaking those set by Khan's previous release Pathaan (2023). Grossing over â‚¹1,148.32 crore (US$140 million), it emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, the second-highest-grossing Hindi film and the fifth highest-grossing Indian film.
